## Library Project

As part of my BTS SIO program, I led a project simulating the development of a loan management application for a library.

This project, carried out independently over a two-week period, had two main components:
- **Java**: Management of books and users
- **PHP**: Management of borrowings and loan tracking

### Project Phases
I was actively involved in all stages of the application's lifecycle:
- **Client Simulation**: Writing specifications and simulated meetings
- **Design**: UML modeling for a clear and optimized architecture
- **Development**: Coding and implementing functionalities in Java and PHP
- **Testing**: Verifications and adjustments to ensure application reliability
- **Production Deployment**: Delivery and deployment of the application

This project allowed me to strengthen my skills in Java and PHP and gain comprehensive experience on a project in near-real conditions.
