## Sortir Project

As part of my **Application Developer Designer** training at ENI, I participated in a project called **Sortir**. Conducted in pairs, this project aimed to develop a Symfony website allowing ENI students and alumni to propose and participate in various activities (sports outings, cultural events, leisure, etc.) organized by other community members.

### My Role and Contributions

I actively contributed to all phases of application development, bringing my expertise in the following areas:

- **Design**: Development of the Conceptual Data Model (CDM) and selection of **PostgreSQL** for a high-performance and structured database.
- **Development**: Coding and integration of key functionalities with **Symfony 6**, **PHP 8** for business logic, and **Twig** for page rendering and user interface.
- **Testing**: Implementation of tests to ensure functionality reliability and optimize user experience by identifying and fixing potential bugs.
- **Production Deployment**: Delivery and final deployment of the application, ensuring its stability and accessibility for users.

### Skills Developed

This project allowed me to strengthen my skills in:

- **Backend Development**: Through the use of Symfony and PHP to create a robust architecture.
- **Teamwork**: Collaboration with a teammate to achieve project goals while respecting time and quality constraints.
- **Project Management**: Active participation in all stages of the development cycle, from design to production.

Thanks to **Sortir**, I gained a better understanding of the tools and methodologies needed to successfully complete a comprehensive web project, from needs analysis to end-user satisfaction.
