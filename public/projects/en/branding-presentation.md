## Brand Presentation Project

During my apprenticeship, I participated in a **brand presentation** project aimed at designing an interactive and aesthetic website for a public exhibition. This project allowed me to apply my skills in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to develop an engaging and immersive user experience.

The site was intended to promote the brand and its services, attracting visitors' attention through a polished and dynamic visual interface. The goal was to create an interactive and intuitive journey while ensuring optimal compatibility for use on **touch screens**.

### Constraints and Technical Aspects

The project involved several key technical constraints:

- **Accessibility**: The site needed to be accessible to a diverse audience and optimized for non-technical users, with simple and intuitive navigation.
- **Touch Compatibility**: Designed for smooth use on touch screens, the site had to respond precisely and quickly to user interactions.
- **Responsiveness**: The design had to automatically adapt to different screen sizes, whether tablets, computers, or large exhibition displays.
- **Dynamism**: Use of JavaScript to create animations and transitions to make the browsing experience more lively and captivating.

### Results and Contributions

This experience allowed me to develop my skills in **frontend development** and **responsive design**. I learned to reconcile aesthetics and ergonomics while respecting technical constraints, which helped strengthen my expertise in creating interfaces for specific environments, such as public exhibitions.
