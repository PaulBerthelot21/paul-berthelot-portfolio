## Personal Portfolio

This personal portfolio was developed to effectively showcase my projects and skills. The objective was to create a modern, performant, and visually appealing platform that reflects my professional identity and technical capabilities.

### Approach and Development

I chose **Next.js** as the main framework to benefit from its optimized performance and hybrid rendering features. **Tailwind CSS** offered me the necessary flexibility to create a customized and responsive design.

### Key Features

- **Responsive design** adapted to all devices
- **Dark/light mode** for an optimal user experience
- **Internationalization** allowing access to content in multiple languages
- **Smooth animations** implemented with Framer Motion
- **Optimized performance** through pre-rendering and static generation
- **Modular architecture** facilitating updates and addition of new projects
