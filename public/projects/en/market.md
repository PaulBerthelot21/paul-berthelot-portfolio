## Market Project

During my apprenticeship, I developed an internal e-commerce site, which we'll call **Market** for confidentiality reasons, designed to facilitate the resale of products between different departments and locations of the company. This project allowed me to work on both the **front-end and back-end** using **Sylius** and **Symfony**.

### Technologies Used

- **Sylius**: Chosen for its flexibility and pre-built blocks adapted to e-commerce functionality management (users, products, orders, promotions, etc.), which allowed for efficiency in development.
- **Symfony & Twig**: Sylius is based on Symfony and uses Twig as a template engine, efficiently managing views and presentation logic.
- **PostgreSQL**: The relational database chosen to store product, user, and order information.

### Contributions and Features

I worked on improving certain existing functional blocks and developing new features specific to the company's needs, including:

- **Customization of E-commerce Blocks**: Adaptation of Sylius's basic functionalities to meet the internal processes of the company.
- **Creation of Custom Features**: Addition of custom modules to manage the specifics of internal reselling between departments.
- **Improvement of User Experience**: Work on the user interface to make navigation more intuitive and adapted to employees.

### Security and Accessibility

As an internal site, **Market** is secured by:
- A **SSO (Single Sign-On)** connection system, ensuring fast and secure user authentication.
- An internal **firewall** to restrict access to authorized employees only.

### Results and Learning

This project allowed me to develop my skills in **designing e-commerce solutions** with Sylius and Symfony, while taking into account **internal security** issues. I also learned to adapt the functionalities of a framework for the specific needs of a company, optimizing internal flow management and ensuring a user experience adapted to employees.
