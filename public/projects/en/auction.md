## Second-Hand Auction Project

This project aims to offer a **second life** to functional objects that are often discarded, by facilitating their transfer through auctions without financial transactions. The objective is to promote **reuse** and encourage **sustainability** by extending the lifespan of products.

### Role and Team
As a **team leader**, I coordinated the efforts of a team consisting of:
- A Backend Developer
- An Integrator
- A Scrum Master

### Features and Iterations

Our team followed an iterative development process to integrate the following main features:
- **User management**: Registration, login, logout, profile display and modification, account deletion
- **Auctions**:
    - Creation of listings for items to be transferred
    - Bidding functionality for each object
    - Display of details for each auction
    - Ability to add a photo for each item
    - List of auctions accessible in both connected and disconnected modes
- **Home page**: Presentation of ongoing auctions and new listings

This project allowed me to apply skills in project management and leadership, while working towards an environmentally responsible goal.
