## WebTools Project

As part of my **BTS SIO**, I completed a 4-month internship at the Groupement Hospitalier Rance Emeraude, where I participated in the **WebTools** project. This project aimed to centralize and simplify access to several digital tools for hospital users, to meet the specific needs of different departments.

### My Role and Contributions

My main role was to improve the user interface **(UX/UI)** of existing applications for visual consistency and a smoother user experience. For this, I designed mockups in Figma to present my design proposals and submit them for user approval.

In parallel, I worked on the back-end of the project with **Oracle SQL** for database management. I wrote several SQL queries to meet the specific needs of applications and automated certain tasks using Shell scripts, reducing manual interventions and improving productivity.

Finally, I wrote **comprehensive documentation**, including tutorials to facilitate project adoption and maintenance.

### Activity Sectors Covered

For confidentiality reasons, I cannot mention all applications, but here are some examples of areas for which tools were developed:

- **Food Service**: Application to manage employee birthdays, with alerts and reminders for event preparation.
- **Pharmacy**: Medication inventory management tool, with notifications in case of shortages.
- **System Administration**: Application listing Shell scripts and scheduled tasks for the technical team.
- **Secretariat**: Management of temporary staff, facilitating planning and monitoring.
- **Psychiatry**: Patient tracking application, including consultation reports and prescriptions.

These tools meet the specific needs of each department, contributing to better internal organization.

### Collaboration and User Feedback

I worked closely with **end users** to understand their expectations, collect **regular feedback**, and adjust features according to their needs. My technical work was done autonomously, with occasional support for solution deployment.

### Project Impact

The improvements made to the user interface allowed users to **save time** on data entry and better navigate through the tools, making their use more intuitive. The **automation** of certain repetitive tasks also helped optimize processes, improving the **productivity** of hospital teams.

### Skills Acquired

This experience allowed me to strengthen my skills in **UX/UI design**, **web development**, and **Oracle database management**. I also learned to work in a demanding hospital environment, adapting my solutions to the varied needs of different departments.
