## QualiWeb Project

The **QualiWeb** project is the main project of my apprenticeship, a web application for **quality** and **project** management. This application consists of two distinct parts: the **frontend** and **backend**, interacting with a PostgreSQL database. For confidentiality reasons, the name has been changed.

### Frontend

The frontend of the application was developed in **Angular 8** when I arrived, then migrated up to **version 11**, before undergoing a **complete redesign** based on **Angular 18**.

The application was designed to be **responsive**, to ensure an optimal user experience on desktop screens (16/9) as well as tablets (4/3). The design follows the **company's graphic charter**, ensuring visual consistency with other internal tools.

It is also **multi-language**, supporting **French**, **English**, and **Hungarian**, to meet the needs of collaborators spread across several sites and regions.

### Backend

The backend is developed in **Symfony 4.4** and **PHP 8.1**, allowing for robust and flexible functionality management. It interacts with a **PostgreSQL** database for user and project data management.

### Developed Modules

The application covers a wide range of functionalities adapted to quality and project management needs, including:

- **SWOT**: Creation and monitoring of SWOTs for different sites/processes.
- **Complaint management**: Tracking complaints and corrective actions.
- **Dashboard and input of indicators / objectives / KPIs**: Tracking performance and strategic objectives.
- **Action management**: Tracking and managing actions to be taken as part of projects.
- **Project management**: Complete management of projects and their progress.
- **Audit input and monitoring**: Module for inputting internal audit results.
- **Hour input and tracking**: Tracking hours spent by collaborators on projects.
- **Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)**: Dedicated module for managing CSR actions and objectives.

### My Role

Upon arrival, my first mission was to **fix existing bugs** and **add features** to modules already in place. Then, I was involved in the development of **new modules** to meet emerging needs within the company.

As the application was constantly evolving, I also participated in the continuous updating of modules to improve performance and user experience. **Approximately 150-200 collaborators** use the application at least once a week, making it a central tool for project and quality management within the company.

### Impact

This project allowed me to strengthen my skills in **web development**, particularly in **multi-technical environments** (Angular, Symfony, PostgreSQL) and in the management of complex applications.
